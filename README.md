# 🌱 AI Sproutie - Your Personal Plant Care Assistant

AI Sproutie is a smart, friendly, and empathetic virtual assistant designed to help you care for your plants with confidence. Built with a powerful backend and a user-friendly demo interface, Sproutie can identify plants, diagnose problems, and provide expert care advice through a natural, conversational chat.

This repository contains the full source code for the FastAPI backend API and the Gradio frontend demo.

## 📁 Project Structure

The project is organized into two main parts: the FastAPI application (`app/`) and the Gradio UI (`app.py`).

```
sproutie-api-project/
├── .gitignore
├── app.py              # Main entry point for Gradio UI and server logic
├── requirements.txt    # Python package dependencies
├── sproutie_system_prompt.md # The core personality and instruction prompt for the AI
└── app/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── database.py     # SQLAlchemy setup (engine, session)
    ├── main.py         # FastAPI app definition and root endpoint
    ├── models.py       # SQLAlchemy database table models
    ├── schemas.py      # Pydantic data validation schemas
    ├── routers/

    └── services/

```

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd sproutie-api-project
```

### 2. Set Up Conda Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

```bash
# Create a new conda environment with Python 3.11
conda create --name sproutie-api python=3.11 -y

# Activate the environment
conda activate sproutie-api
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install all the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

You need to provide your Google Gemini API key.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the root of the project directory.
2.  Add your API key to this file:

    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
    *(The `.gitignore` file is already configured to ignore this file, keeping your key secure.)*

### 5. System Prompt

Make sure the `sproutie_system_prompt.md` file is present in the root directory. This file defines the AI's personality, expertise, and rules of engagement.

## ▶️ Running the Application

To run the complete application (both the FastAPI backend and the Gradio UI), execute the following command from the root directory:

```bash
python app.py
```

This will:
1.  Create the `sproutie.db` SQLite database file if it doesn't exist.
2.  Start the FastAPI server in a background thread on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
3.  Launch the Gradio web interface, which you can access at **`http://127.0.0.1:7860`**.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:7860` in your web browser to start chatting with Sproutie!

## 🌐 API Endpoints

The FastAPI backend exposes the following endpoints, running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

<details>
<summary><strong>API Endpoint Details</strong></summary>

- **`POST /v1/chat`**
  - **Type:** `multipart/form-data`
  - **Description:** Handles a chat message, including optional image uploads. Manages session creation and state.
  - **Form Fields:**
    - `user_id` (str, required)
    - `message` (str, required)
    - `session_id` (str, optional)
    - `image` (file, optional)

- **`GET /api/v1/chat/history`**
  - **Type:** Query Parameters
  - **Description:** Retrieves the full message history for a specific conversation.
  - **Query Parameters:**
    - `user_id` (str, required)
    - `session_id` (int, required)

</details>

## 💻 API Usage Examples (`curl`)

These examples demonstrate how to use the API from the command line using `curl`. For the best experience, especially with conversation history, using an API client like **Postman** is highly recommended. These commands are tested to work on Linux, macOS, and Git Bash on Windows.

### Turn 1: Send a Message with an Image
Git bash:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat" \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-F "api_key=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" \
-F "message=What is this plant?" \
-F "history=[]" \
-F "image=@/path/to/your/plant.jpg"
```

Postman:
```bash
curl --location 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat' \
--form 'api_key="AIzaSyCwHGlu1qvMW43uVLmNGToD0CiS56QFCCs"' \
--form 'message="Hi, what'\''s this plant?"' \
--form 'history="[]"' \
--form 'image=@"/C:/Users/minhq/Downloads/1572060934-cay-luoi-ho-van.jpg"'
```

### Turn 2: Send a Follow-up Message (Using History)
First, copy the entire history array from the JSON response of the previous turn. Then, paste it as the value for the -F "history=..." argument.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat" \
-H "accept: application/json" \
-F "api_key=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" \
-F "message=How much water does it need?" \
-F "history=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is this plant?\", \"file_references\": [{\"name\": \"files/abc-123\", \"mime_type\": \"image/jpeg\"}]}, {\"role\": \"model\", \"content\": \"That is a Monstera Deliciosa!\"}]"
```
(Note: For the history argument, the JSON string must be valid, and internal double quotes must be escaped with a backslash (\\") on the command line.)


## 🤗 Deploying to Hugging Face Spaces

This project is structured for easy deployment to Hugging Face Spaces.

1.  Create a new Space on Hugging Face.
2.  Choose **Gradio** as the SDK.
3.  Link it to your GitHub repository or upload the files manually.
4.  Go to the **Settings** tab of your new Space.
5.  Navigate to **Repository secrets** and add a new secret:
    - **Name:** `GEMINI_API_KEY`
    - **Secret value:** Paste your actual Google Gemini API key here.
6.  The Space will build automatically using the `app.py` entry point and `requirements.txt` file.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- **Streaming Responses:** Implement response streaming to make the chatbot feel more interactive and "live".
- **AI-Generated Suggestions:** Prompt the AI to suggest relevant follow-up questions to guide the user.
- **Full User Authentication:** Replace the simple `user_id` string with a proper JWT-based authentication system for a production app.
- **Dockerization:** Create a `Dockerfile` to containerize the application for deployment on other cloud platforms.
